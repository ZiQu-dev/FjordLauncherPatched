# Installation

## Windows

Run exe with administrator and extract software whenever you want to. After that run **fjordlauncher.exe**.

You can also use the "*.7z release*" to unzip it without admin rights if you know how to use an archiver.

## Linux

Just run executable. Should be running without errors. However if you ran into problems, it should be easily fixable by installing Qt6Core5Compat library. _Well... It works on my machine._

## MacOS

I GAMBLED AND **WON!**
I DID IT, I F*CKING DID IT!
It's gonna be available soon™️

~~I tried compiling it for Apple Silicon, but basically my C++ compiler on my M1 Macbook said ___f*ck you___ so there's no MacOS version :c~~

~~However I wish you good luck and having fun trying to compile it yourself on this _sh*thole_ of the platform.~~

~~_Trust me I also thought it was 20 minute adventure which was in and out._~~

# Building

To build the launcher yourself, follow [the instructions on the Prism Launcher website](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/development/build-instructions) but clone this repo instead.
